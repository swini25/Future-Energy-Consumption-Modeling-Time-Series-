# Future-Energy-Consumption-Modeling-Time-Series


A significant investor or financial institution would only consider investing in energy-saving initiatives if they are projected to yield long-term profitability. This requires demonstrating substantial energy savings over time to justify the investment. By accurately predicting future energy consumption based on historical data from different meters, we aim to provide more reliable estimates for energy-saving investments. This approach encourages investment in building efficiencies, fostering progress in sustainable practices.

And for the project description:

The project aims to forecast energy meter readings across four types—Electricity, Chilled Water, Steam, and Hot Water—using historical usage data and observed weather conditions over a one-year period. Our main objective is to develop predictive models that accurately forecast energy consumption for each building and energy type in our dataset. Our approach involves implementing time-series forecasting models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), as well as classical models including Linear Regression and LGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Method). This allows us to determine the most effective approach—whether through time-series analysis or regression—for optimizing energy consumption predictions.
